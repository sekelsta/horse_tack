This license only covers parts of the code written by me (sekelsta). It does not cover what was added by commit  5590a4afb5fb0be98efd847ab8a20dc7f4fe7ee8


This is reference code for creating mods, available under the MIT license. If you make a mod out of it that you want to publish, please at least change to modid to something unique so it won't conflict with Horse Tack (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/horse-tack).
