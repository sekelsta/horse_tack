I'd love to credit the texture authors for the original:
jumping, western and english tack and the leggings I reused for the riding tack

 but I'm afraid I can't find their source.
The originals were/are available on the Nova Skin Gallery.
Modifications have been made to all of them by my own hand.

Thanks to Світлана for the Ukrainian translation uk_ua.json'''
